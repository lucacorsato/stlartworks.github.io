# St. Louis ArtWorks is AWESOME!
We are excited to give young creatives (14 - 19 years old) job training and paychecks each year.

Every teen accepted into our program works as an "apprentice" alongside a professional artist to learn a multitude of creative skills. All of the projects are either sold at a public sale, commissioned for public and private clients, or performed publicly.

# Established in 1995  
ArtWorks has worked with over 2,700 underserved youth from the St. Louis Region. Apprentices take away a long lasting set of experiences, as well as a resume and portfolio of real work and references.
