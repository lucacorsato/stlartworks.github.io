I'm an awesomizer. Wait, what is that? I only want to spend my time working on things that are going to be awesome with people that actively pursue this same goal.

Background:
- Double major in studio art and art history from Colby College
- Master's in Social Work from Wash U
- One class short of a Master's in Art Therapy from SIUE
- Graduate of RAC's Community Arts Training program (CAT)
- Answered local and National Suicide hotline
- Facilitator of Anytown's youth diversity camp
- Taught CAMSTL's New Art in the Neighborhood
- Self taught photographer, designer and web developer
- Lead web designer at Anheuser-Busch
- Designed and coded Anheuser-busch.com by myself

I care about my family above all things. I believe in empowering youth to make great things. I see good things happening in STL. Artworks is one of them. Teamwork makes the dream work. Stay awesome!
