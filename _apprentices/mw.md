During my time at SLAW I have grown as a person, as an artist, and as an employee. I have learned how to manage my time and money better. I have learned that just because you have a lot of time to finish doesn’t mean you should wait until the last minute because anything can happen. I learned how to work with a variety of partners on projects. I have grown to take pride in the things I do. Before this summer at ArtWorks I didn’t have a true understanding of being prideful and showing off. I have truly enjoyed my time at ArtWorks because I have gained life skills that I will apply in my future.
