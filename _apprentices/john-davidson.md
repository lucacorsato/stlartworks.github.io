When I joined ArtWorks I did not expect it to be a life changing experience. Before ArtWorks, I was struggling and debating with myself on my future in the arts. I did not have the confidence to pursue my lifelong dream of being an audio engineer or video producer. ArtWorks gave me the ability to showcase my talent and learn from others. Because of ArtWorks, I have more knowledge of advanced program such as Final Cut Pro X and Photoshop CS4. This will assist me with my career choice and opportunities along the way. I would recommend this ArtWorks program to anyone interested in expressing themselves through art. The program managers and instructors want to see you succeed and be your absolute best. There are no limitations to creativity in ArtWorks and it enabled me to be outspoken and content.
