My experience here has been phenomenal! I’ve learned so much from the first day to the last. I’ve been ecstatic since first getting my acceptance. I was shocked to be one of the 92 chosen out of over 500 applicants. I’m so grateful to have something to do over the summer that was beneficial. I’ve had wonderful instructors and coworkers. I’ve learned to be more independent and compassionate about every opportunity.
