Working at ArtWorks for over a year now has been a wonderful experience. ArtWorks has taught me many life skills that I will never forget. How to professionally talk in a client meeting, how to budget my money and my spending, and how to embrace my leadership skills. ArtWorks should be recommended to all teens, especially young teens to give them a starting point, sort of a fresh start. ArtWorks can provide help to all sorts of people. You don’t necessarily have to be an artist to have this job, you just have to have the ambition to at least try to get the job done. ArtWorks isn’t just a job it’s a life lesson. They require that you write/type a resume while working in the program. They’re preparing you for the real work job environment, this is an actual starting point. Scholarship opportunities are also offered in the program as well. ArtWorks is a tremendous program that should not be passed up or taken for granted.
