In the beginning when I first came into St. Louis ArtWorks, I was shy and quiet.  The way that I introduced myself was not confident enough, and I didn’t know how to open up to new people.  

The more I was in St. Louis ArtWorks, the more I started to gain confidence on my art work at home.  I began to learn more about introducing myself and explaining what I do here at St. Louis ArtWorks.  I learned that its very important to explain your art piece to people because that person wants to know what it’s about.  I noticed that every time I walk I walk into the store called “Swedlife” the person that works there explains what their stuff in their store is all about and the more he explains, the more I draw attention to the things that’s in “Swedlife.”  From that on, I was really starting to realize how important it is to explain to people about your art piece.  I’ve also learned that cooperating and being creative is important as a visual artist.  I learned that creativity should NOT be limited because you would never know how valuable or important it is.

I’ve also learned that effort is important too.  In the beginning we all didn’t put too much effort into printing and now realize that this is not just Screen printing when you’re at St. Louis ArtWorks because you never know what type of people would appreciate it.

I also remember what Pricilla was saying one day.  She was saying that “when you print an image on a shirt, make sure your not just printing, but make sure your message is telling a story.”  And that lets me know that when you do any type of art piece, make sure its saying something, not just showing an image.  I also learned that it’s not good to wait for something when works.  You have to make something happen.
