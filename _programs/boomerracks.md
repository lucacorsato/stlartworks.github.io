Apprentices are creating a bike rack for St Louis ArtWorksâ€™  brand new flagship location at 5959 Delmar. They will also learn about 3D design as they build birdhouses and unique upcycled furniture. These Creative Futures teens also receive one-on-one support from our staff around personal, educational, and career goal setting and college support.
